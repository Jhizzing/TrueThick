# TrueThick

TrueThick is a lightweight Streamlit application for calculating true thickness, alpha and beta angles from drillhole and structural orientation data using kenometer-standard definitions.

## Features
- Hole orientation input (azimuth, dip)
- Structure orientation input (dip direction, dip)
- Kenometer alpha calculation
- True thickness calculation
- Beta angle output

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Philosophy
Built by a geo, for geos. Field-first, structurally correct, no fluff.
